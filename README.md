# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison

- In HyperDrive, accuracy is 0.908. In AutoML, accuracy is 0.91669.

- In HyperDrive, architecture contains only single model. In AutoML, architecture contains around 31 different models. So AutoML architecture was better and contains more different options.

## Future work

- In HyperDrive, we have used only two parameters of 'LogisticRegression' model : (C, max_iter). For future experiments, areas of improvement can be to use other parameters like : (penalty, dual, tol, fit_intercept, intercept_scaling, class_weight, solver, multi_class, warm_start, l1_ratio). May be these improvements might help in increasing the model performance. 

- In HyperDrive, we have used model 'LogisticRegression'. For future experiments, areas of improvement can be to use other models. May be these improvements might help in increasing the performance.

- In AutoML, we have used number of cross validations : 3. For future experiments, areas of improvement can be to change number of cross validations and may be also change other automl settings. May be these improvements might help in increasing the model performance.
