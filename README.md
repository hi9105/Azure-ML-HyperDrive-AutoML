# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

![All Runs](images/All_Runs.JPG)

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work

- With HyperDrive, we have used only two parameters : (C, max_iter). For future experiments, areas of improvement can be to use other parameters like : (penalty, dual, tol, fit_intercept, intercept_scaling, class_weight, solver, multi_class, warm_start, l1_ratio). May be these improvements might help the model performance. 

- With HyperDrive, we have used model 'LogisticRegression'. For future experiments, areas of improvement can be to use other models. May be these improvements might help improving the performance.
